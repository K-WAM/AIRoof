## Active assignments

| Agent | Worktree (absolute) | Branch | Tasks | Owned scope | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Worker A — Codex Sol 5.6 (extra high) | *(worktree removed post-merge)* | `task/p0-authority` (deleted, merged) | T-010, T-011 | `src/lib/vapi/verify.ts`; auth/dedupe + lookup/cancel dispatch in `src/app/api/webhooks/vapi/route.ts`; `lookupAppointment`/`cancelAppointment` symbols in `src/lib/tools/agentTools.ts`; `src/lib/vapi/__tests__/**` | **merged** — commits `e0d5699`, `3fdb15f`, merge `36dde56` |
| Worker B — Deepseek V4 Pro | *(worktree removed post-merge)* | `task/ci-foundation` (deleted, merged) | T-000, T-001, T-002 | `package.json`+lock, `vitest.config.ts`, `.github/**`, `src/test-utils/**`, `.env.example`, `next.config.ts`, cookie lines in `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` | **merged** — commits `25cea58`/`824c2a4`/`14dc957`, reviewer fix `d30c58b`, merge `9e4ccfd` |
| Worker A2 — Codex Sol 5.6 (extra high) | `D:\Apps\air-wt-shared-primitives` | `task/shared-primitives` | T-021, T-022 | `src/lib/ops/**` (new, incl. `__tests__`), `src/types/ops.ts` (new); `src/lib/schemas/**` (new, incl. adversarial fixtures) | ready — not started |
| Worker B2 — Deepseek V4 Pro | `D:\Apps\air-wt-config-guard` | `task/config-guard` | T-020 | `src/lib/config/env.ts` (new), `src/lib/auth/cronGuard.ts` (new), `src/app/api/health/route.ts` | ready — not started |

**Assignment rationale (A/B, Phase 1):** P0 authority work (T-010/T-011) needed adversarial edge-case rigor (replay, timing-safe compare, cross-tenant identity leaks) — routed to the higher-reasoning-effort agent. CI/scaffolding (T-000-002) was well-trodden config breadth — routed to the general-purpose agent.

**Assignment rationale (A2/B2, Phase 2):** T-021 (transactional Firestore claim/dedupe under concurrent writers) and T-022 (adversarial zod fixtures for the AI/tool trust boundary, incl. prompt-injection-shaped payloads) both need the same edge-case rigor Codex already proved out in Batch A — routed there. T-020 (env validation + a Bearer-auth guard) is small, mechanical, well-trodden — routed to Deepseek alone; it's a thinner batch (1 task) but has no dependency on A2's tasks, so both can run fully in parallel. No file overlap between the two worktrees.

**Review findings this cycle:** Batch A's own report was accurate and reproduced clean. Batch B's report mischaracterized a real defect as "pre-existing" (see IMPLEMENTATION_LOG.md T-000/T-002 reviewer-correction entry) — 3 type errors in its own new test files, one of which would have broken CI at the exact moment Batch A merged (it asserted `VAPI_AUTH_BYPASS` semantics T-010 removes). Fixed directly as trivial defects, both batches merged clean after a combined 41/41-test, type-check/lint/build-green regression gate on `main` at `36dde56`.

## Blockers

- None for Batch A/B. T-010 **deploy** (not development) is blocked on NH-1 + NH-2.

## HELP-NEEDED

- (empty — workers append per AGENTS.md stuck protocol)

## NEEDS-HUMAN

| ID | Needed | Blocks | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| NH-1 | Vapi dashboard: set server-URL secret; confirm assistant model/voice/7 tool schemas/retry/recording; remove any bypass config; extend `cancelAppointment` with optional `confirmCancellation` (boolean) and `appointmentNumber` (integer) parameters without renaming the tool or legacy `appointmentId` | T-010/T-011 deploy | Console-only; CLI cannot read Vapi dashboard |
| NH-2 | Vercel env: set `VAPI_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (must match NH-1), `CRON_SECRET`, `RESEND_FROM=no-reply@luxordev.com`; **remove `VAPI_AUTH_BYPASS`** | T-010/T-032/T-041 deploy | Integrator can run `vercel env add` after `vercel link` once owner approves values; owner may just say "generate CRON_SECRET yourself" |
| NH-3 | Resend: verify `luxordev.com` sending domain (SPF/DKIM DNS records); approve sender `no-reply@luxordev.com` | T-041 live verification | DNS access required |
| NH-4 | Legal/privacy: recording disclosure wording, retention windows, deletion policy, callback consent, emergency-message wording | T-042 sign-off (dev proceeds with 90d defaults) | Owner/legal |
| NH-5 | Product: confirm defaults D-1 (booking = requested time) and D-2 (demo isolation = in-code guards, same project) or override | T-030/T-035 final | Defaults proceed unless overridden |
| NH-6 | Decide whether `daily-call-summary` + `faq-suggestions` get scheduled in `vercel.json` | T-032 scope edge | Routes get secured either way |
| NH-7 | GitHub branch protection on `main` (require CI green) | T-050 completion | Integrator has `gh` ready: needs owner OK to change repo settings |
| NH-8 | Human click tests: calendar drag→confirm on desktop browser; `/field` QR + hold-to-speak on a real phone | T-030/T-034 acceptance | 10 minutes with the live app |
| NH-9 | Callback consent policy for pre-existing leads (auto-call grandfathered leads or not) | T-032 backfill | Default: existing leads are NOT auto-called |
| NH-10 | Official Luxor Developments LLC website/social URLs, if any should appear in emails/guides | T-041/T-052 content | None on record — nothing will be invented |
| NH-11 | Firestore TTL: enable collection-group TTL policies on `_vapiWebhookEvents.expiresAt` and `vapiAppointmentConfirmations.expiresAt` | T-010/T-011 deploy | Code writes server-clock timestamp fields; production TTL policy requires an authenticated console/gcloud deployment action by the integrator |

## Deferred (from CIB — do not schedule without owner request)

Pagination/search/virtualization; richer demo seed data; field-theme unification; toast component unification
beyond T-040's single banner; offline field queue; operator replay console; SMS; Google Calendar OAuth; Stripe.
